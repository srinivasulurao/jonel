ABOUT

    This is the dotProject Help Desk Module.  If you would like to contribute
    to this project, please contact dotmods-helpdesk@lists.sourceforge.net.

PERMISSIONS

    The Help Desk uses built in dotProject permissions to its best abilities.
    The permission system is layed out as follows. Please note that company
    pormissions aren't that of the Companies module, but those of the Help
    Desk module. When editing a user's permissions, select the Help Desk
    module, not the Companies module, to assign permissions.

    Let our example user be Joe

    1. Joe will always have read and write permissions to items he created, was
    assigned to or was the requestor for.

    2. Jow will have read access to items for company X if he has read access
    to company X for the Help Desk module.

    3. Joe will have write access to items for company X if he has write access
    to company X for the Help Desk module.

    4. Joe will be able to create items only if he has write permissions for at
    least one company in the Help Desk module.

    5. Joe will be able to assign items to people in companies he has write
    access for in the Help Desk module. He will also be able to assign items to
    people in the company which hosts the Help Desk, if the company was
    selected on the Help Desk module configuration screen.

    6. Joe will be able to select an item requestor from a list of users from
    companies he has write access to in the Help Desk module.
