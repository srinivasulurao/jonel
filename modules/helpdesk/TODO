For anyone interested, here is a list of things we'd like to get done

1. E-mail integration. E-mails sent to HelpDesk should create new HelpDesk
   entries.

2. Add immediate population of phone number and contact e-mail fields when a
   requestor is selected from the pop-up box.

3. Possible use of HTMLArea for the comments box.

In Progress:
1. Integration with Files. HelpDesk items should be allowed to have file
   attachements.
